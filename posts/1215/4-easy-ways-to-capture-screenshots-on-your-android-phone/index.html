Taking a screenshot with this method is easy, simply press the power and volume down buttons at the same time for a couple seconds, until you hear a shutter sound or until your screen flashes. This method is supported on most Android devices, including phones and tablets.\n1. Method 1: Power + Volume Down Button The first method to capture screenshots on an Android phone is by pressing the Power + Volume Down button. This method works on most Android phones, the only exception being some Samsung devices, which require you to press the Power + Home Button instead. Once both buttons are pressed together, the device will save an image of the current screen in the Gallery app. This method is the quickest and most convenient way to capture screenshots on an Android phone.\n2. Method 2: Using Quick Setting Panel The first way to capture a screenshot on any Android phone is by pressing the Power + Volume Down button at the same time.
