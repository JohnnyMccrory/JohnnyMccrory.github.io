The battery levels of each AirPod you are currently using can be seen under your device&rsquo;s Bluetooth settings. Additionally, if you open the case of your AirPods near your device, you can see an estimated battery life for each earbud, as well as the charging case.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://johnnymccrory.github.io/posts/1409/easily-track-your-lost-phone-with-google/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Easily Track Your Lost Phone with Google</span></a>
