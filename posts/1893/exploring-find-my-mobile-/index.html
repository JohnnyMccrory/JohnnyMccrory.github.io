Google focuses more on making it difficult for robbers to unlock the device, with two-step verification and automatic locking of the device when an incorrect password is entered multiple times.</p><p>Overall, both Samsung&rsquo;s Find My Mobile feature and Google&rsquo;s Find My Device feature have their own advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the user&rsquo;s needs, either of them can be a great option for tracking and protecting your device.</p><h3 id=6-conclusion>6. Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#6-conclusion>#</a></h3><p>Comparing the features of Find My Mobile offered by Samsung and Google provides some interesting insights into the different approaches taken by each company. Samsung offers its Find My Mobile feature as part of its Galaxy Apps services, which allows users to locate, lock, and remotely erase their device. Google provides a similar service, called Android Device Manager, through its Google Play Store. Both services allow users to find their device on the map, lock it, and remotely erase data if needed. However, Samsung&rsquo;s Find My Mobile also provides additional features such as the ability to control the device&rsquo;s settings remotely and an SOS message service that can be sent to trusted contacts. Google&rsquo;s Android Device Manager is limited to locating, locking, and erasing data on the device. Both services are free, however Samsung&rsquo;s service allows for more control over the device and additional features.</p><div style=position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;height:0;overflow:hidden><iframe src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/yTiJE6C8R_I style=position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;border:0 allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe></div><p>Q1.
